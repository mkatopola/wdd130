                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                </p>
                <p>              
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate 
                    such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer 
                    to both.

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                    <p>
                        Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty 
                        Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        This 84-mile 6-day trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, 
                        evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
                        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>
                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living 
                    near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged 
                    beauty of the river that they never left.
                <p>
                    Common animals sighted here include elks, deer, bears and bighorn sheep. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring 
                    ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                    undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                    and colder in the early summer in the late summer.There are good  rapids all summer.
