          I am a Qualified Medical laboratory Technician working at a government
          health facility. My primary role is to conduct laboratory tests on
          patient samples to determine the cause of their illness so that they
          can receive proper healthcare and treatment. Finding the cause also
          helps to establish proper preventive measures to avoid further spread
          or recurrence of the disease.

          I am also an Online student at BYU-Idaho, pursuing a degree in
          Software Development. With rapid advancement in technology, I believe
          that adding programming skills to my skillset will help me to serve my
          clients better. I would like to develop applications that will enhance
          and improve the health delivery system such us early detection of
          outbreaks, effective management of client records, providing health
          information to the public through web applications and mobile
          applications to complement the Ministry of healthâ€™s efforts of
          providing health information to every citizen.
